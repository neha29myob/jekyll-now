With orientation being done, we are officially in the acceleration program @MYOB. With so many different things on my plate including but not limited to reading books, getting comfortable with CLI & Git, coding challenge, brush up my java, javaScript, C#, self learning on some of the languages like React, Node.js, an awesome pool of mentors and guidance is what one could ask for.  

GIT basics:
Git is a tricky thing to get my head around, especially without the source tree (GUIs). This section is a simple walkthrough of GIT workflow using the command line to get started - covering the basic commands for making the code changes , opening a pull request, branching and merging into the master, etc.

1. Before getting started , GIT needs to be configured with user details. 

    git configÂ - Get and set repository or global options
		  $ git config --global user.name 'User Name'
		  $ git config --global user.email 'you@anydomain.com'
