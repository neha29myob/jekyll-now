Git is a tricky thing to get my head around, especially without the source tree (GUIs). This section is a simple walkthrough of GIT workflow using the command line to get started - covering the basic commands for making the code changes , opening a pull request, branching and merging into the master, etc.

1. Before getting started , GIT needs to be configured with user details. 

    <b> git config: </b> Get and set repository or global options 
    ``bash
    $ git config --global user.name 'User Name'
    ``
    ```bash
    $ git config --global user.email 'you@anydomain.com'
    ```
2. There are 2 ways to get started : create a new repository or copy an existing from somewhere else.
     ```bash
     $ git init: initialise/create a repository
     $ git clone <path-to-repo>: copy/clone an existing repository 
     ```
     ``` bash
     $ git clone git@github.com:neha29myob/String-Calculator-Kata.git
     ```
     This command will copy the files from remote server to the local repo.
     
3. Make changes, track changes.
    ```bash
    $ git status: displays the repository status.
    ```
    It will show a list of all the files affected during work, plus any files added or removed since last commit. 
    ```bash
    $ git diff: displays the actual changes made for all the files edited. 
    ```
    Adding a <filename> at the end of the command will only show the changes for that file.
	
4. Add files to staging environment.
    ```bash
    $ git add: Add contents of the file to the staging area.
    ```
    ```bash
    $git add -A: This will add modified, deleted and new files to the staging area.
    ```
    ```bash
    $git add <filepath>: This adds one file specified in the path to the staging area.
    ```
    ```bash
    $git add . :This will add all files which have been either modified or deleted to the staging area.
    ```
    
5. Create a commit.
    ```bash
    $git commit -m "message about the commit"
    ```
    Once all the desired files and folders are in the staging area, this command will commit the changes to the repository.
   
6. Create a branch.
    ```bash
     git checkout -b
     ```
     It will create a new branch and then move the user to that branch, off of the master branch.
     This comes really handy if one is worried to make changes to the main project while developing a feature. Once all the 	 changes has been done, it can be merged with the master branch.
     
 7. Push a branch to GitHub. 
    ```bash
    $git push origin branchName
    ```
    This will push all the changes onto the branch on GitHub. "origin" here is just a shorthand of remote repository's URL.
